In this area, it was checked whether there were any gaps, values or outliers in the data, and each column was examined and analyzed separately. Getdummies for ML Engineer were made and data was made available for machine learning.



  <h2>EDA  </h2>
   In The EDA you could see that the analyses of the data and some visializations of the datas, also I put some correlation matrix for our ML Engineer to choose Features for ML MODEL
